    "types": [
      "isotope"
    ],
    "reason": "All three LLMs correctly identify O18 as an isotope of oxygen. O18 (Oxygen-18) is indeed a stable isotope of oxygen with 8 protons and 10 neutrons, commonly used in paleoclimatology and other earth science applications for isotopic analysis."

      "producer"
    ],
    "reason": "The sun functions as the primary producer of energy for Earth's environmental systems, driving photosynthesis, weather patterns, and climate processes. While astronomically it's a star, in the context of earth and environmental science from the SWEET ontology, 'producer' best captures its fundamental role as the energy source that powers Earth's environmental processes."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_2e260457",
    "types": [
      "isotope"
    ],
    "reason": "All three models correctly identify th230 as an isotope. The term clearly refers to Thorium-230, where 'Th' is the chemical symbol for thorium and '230' indicates the mass number of this specific isotope. This is a standard scientific notation for isotopes."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_1e9ed9ae",
    "types": [
      "spatial configuration"
    ],
    "reason": "The term 'far field' describes a specific spatial arrangement or region in space defined by its distance from a source, where field behavior follows predictable patterns. This represents a particular way of organizing or configuring space relative to a source, making 'spatial configuration' the most accurate classification among the three options."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_7ff90784",
    "types": [
      "trust"
    ],
    "reason": "All three models consistently predict 'trust' for the term 'acceptable'. This classification makes sense as 'acceptable' represents a judgment of quality or adequacy, which directly relates to the concept of trust in environmental standards and decision-making contexts."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_6b101b0a",
    "types": [
      "qualifier"
    ],
    "reason": "The term 'submarginal' functions as a modifier that describes something below a certain threshold or standard. It qualifies other terms by indicating a characteristic or quality level, making it best classified as a qualifier rather than a standalone property or role."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_8b5c0524",
    "types": [
      "shape"
    ],
    "reason": "The term 'flake' primarily describes a physical form or geometry - specifically a small, flat, thin piece. While it could relate to particles or physical states, 'shape' most accurately captures the defining characteristic of what makes something a flake: its distinctive flat, thin morphology rather than its particle nature or state of matter."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_f3ca47f9",
    "types": [
      "inorganic compound"
    ],
    "reason": "All three LLMs correctly identify iron oxide as an inorganic compound. Iron oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083) is a chemical compound composed of iron and oxygen atoms, lacking carbon-based structures that characterize organic compounds. This classification aligns with standard chemical taxonomy in earth and environmental science contexts."

    "types": [
      "dimensionless ratio"
    ],
    "reason": "All three predictions correctly identify the Rossby number as a dimensionless ratio. This term represents the ratio of inertial forces to Coriolis forces in fluid dynamics, making it a dimensionless quantity. The predictions are unanimous and accurate."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_53c5bd17",
    "types": [
      "trust"
    ],
    "reason": "All three LLMs correctly identified 'unconfident' as belonging to the 'trust' category, which is appropriate since it represents a state of confidence or certainty level, similar to reliability and belief measures in the SWEET ontology."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_5c920fb8",
    "types": [
      "duration"
    ],
    "reason": "All three LLMs correctly identify 'pentad' as a duration, which is accurate since a pentad specifically refers to a five-day period. This classification aligns well with the SWEET Ontology's concept of duration as a temporal measurement."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_3747460e",
    "types": [
      "isotope"
    ],
    "reason": "All three predictions correctly identify pb204 as an isotope of lead (Pb), with the number 204 representing the mass number. This is a clear and accurate classification within the SWEET Ontology framework for earth and environmental sciences."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_158a5f30",
    "types": [
      "horizontal direction"
    ],
    "reason": "All three LLMs unanimously predict \"horizontal direction\" as the correct type for the term \"horizontal\". This is the most specific and accurate classification, as \"horizontal\" directly refers to a spatial direction parallel to the horizon, making \"horizontal direction\" the optimal match from the available ontology terms."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_d03eec09",
    "types": [
      "chemical role"
    ],
    "reason": "Photodissociate describes a functional role in chemical processes where light breaks molecular bonds. While the other predictions focus on the outcome (chemical state), the term itself represents the active role or function that light plays in chemical decomposition, making \"chemical role\" the most accurate classification."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_422ba0cb",
    "types": [
      "cfc"
    ],
    "reason": "All three predictions correctly identify dichlorodifluoromethane as a CFC (chlorofluorocarbon). This is accurate as dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl2F2) is indeed a well-known CFC compound, also known as Freon-12, which has been widely studied for its ozone-depleting properties and environmental impact."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_e090a1fc",
    "types": [
      "spectral band"
    ],
    "reason": "All three LLMs correctly identified ultraviolet as a spectral band. This is accurate since ultraviolet represents a specific range of electromagnetic radiation (approximately 10-400 nm wavelength) that is commonly used in earth and environmental science applications including atmospheric studies, remote sensing, and solar radiation monitoring."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_d0d2658e",
    "types": [
      "period"
    ],
    "reason": "The Triassic is a geological period within the Mesozoic Era, not an epoch. In the geological time scale hierarchy, periods are larger divisions than epochs. The Triassic period (252-201 million years ago) is correctly classified as a period, making the gpt-4o and gemini-2.5-pro predictions accurate, while deepseek-chat incorrectly identifies it as an epoch."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_30dfa770",
    "types": [
      "x class"
    ],
    "reason": "All three predictions correctly identify 'x13 class' as belonging to 'x class'. This is accurate as x13 class refers to an extremely powerful solar flare classification where 'x class' represents the highest category of solar flares in space weather monitoring, with '13' indicating the intensity level within that class."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_73163901",
    "types": [
      "biological state"
    ],
    "reason": "The term 'dormant' primarily refers to a state of reduced metabolic activity and growth in biological systems, such as dormant seeds, hibernating animals, or inactive microorganisms. While it can apply to geological features like volcanoes, in earth and environmental science contexts, it most commonly describes biological processes and organisms in a state of temporary inactivity, making 'biological state' the most appropriate classification."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_703bd7c8",
    "types": [
      "vertical direction"
    ],
    "reason": "The term 'down' specifically indicates movement or orientation along the vertical axis toward a lower position, making 'vertical direction' the most precise classification. While 'direction' is correct, 'vertical direction' is more specific and accurately captures the dimensional aspect of downward movement in space."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_444cb580",
    "types": [
      "shape"
    ],
    "reason": "The term 'acute' most commonly refers to a geometric property describing angles less than 90 degrees, making 'shape' the most appropriate classification from the available options in the SWEET Ontology context."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_3a11961a",
    "types": [
      "self describing format"
    ],
    "reason": "NetCDF3 is specifically a self-describing data format rather than just a generic format. The \"self-describing\" aspect is crucial because NetCDF files contain metadata that describes the data structure, dimensions, variables, and attributes within the file itself, making it particularly valuable for scientific data exchange and long-term data preservation in earth and environmental sciences."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_40496536",
    "types": [
      "solid state"
    ],
    "reason": "Two out of three predictions correctly identify crystal as 'solid state'. A crystal is fundamentally defined by its physical state - being a solid material with atoms arranged in a highly ordered, repeating structure. This physical state classification is more accurate than 'mineral assessment' which refers to an evaluation process rather than the inherent nature of crystals themselves."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_5782aa24",
    "types": [
      "trust"
    ],
    "reason": "All three LLMs correctly identified \"trusted\" as type \"trust\". This is the most accurate classification as \"trusted\" is an adjective form directly related to the concept of trust, representing confidence, reliability, or belief in something's credibility within the SWEET ontology framework."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_386ec924",
    "types": [
      "age"
    ],
    "reason": "The Rhuddanian is specifically a geological age (chronostratigraphic unit) within the Silurian Period, not an epoch. In geological timescale hierarchy, ages are subdivisions of epochs. The Rhuddanian represents the earliest age of the Llandovery Epoch in the Silurian Period, making 'age' the most precise and accurate classification."
  },
  {
    "id": "TT_154d3230",
    "types": [
      "angular coordinate"
    ],
    "reason": "Both deepseek-chat and gemini-2.5-pro predict \"angular coordinate\" which is more specific and accurate than \"angular direction\". Theta is indeed used as an angular coordinate in coordinate systems (polar, spherical, cylindrical) to define position, not just direction."
