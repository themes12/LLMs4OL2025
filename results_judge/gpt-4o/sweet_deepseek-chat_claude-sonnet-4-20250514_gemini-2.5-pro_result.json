The tropics are defined by specific geographic and latitudinal boundaries, extending from the Tropic of Cancer to the Tropic of Capricorn. This classification aligns well with the SWEET Ontology's definition of a latitude band, making it a more suitable choice than climatic conditions like 'wet summer dry winter climate', which may also occur in other regions."
